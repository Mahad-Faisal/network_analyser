# Wi-Fi Information Dashboard

Welcome to the **Wi-Fi Information Dashboard**! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

Living in a densely populated area with numerous neighbors and overlapping Wi-Fi signals can be a challenge. Interference from multiple networks can impact your internet speed and connection stability. That's where our Wi-Fi Information Dashboard comes in!

This project provides a user-friendly way to monitor your Wi-Fi network and gain insights into nearby networks. With real-time data on signal strength, channel usage, and other crucial metrics, you can make informed decisions to optimize your network performance and minimize interference.

## Features

- **Current Wi-Fi Info**: Get an at-a-glance view of your networkâ€™s key metrics such as SSID, signal strength, and more.
- **Detailed Stats**: Dive deeper into specific details about your Wi-Fi network, including authentication methods, encryption, and network profile.
- **Network Visualization**: View a graphical representation of signal strength and channel usage of visible networks in your vicinity.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The dashboard refreshes automatically every minute to ensure you have the latest information at your fingertips.

## Why This Project?

In areas with many competing networks, it's common to experience degraded performance due to channel congestion and interference. This tool helps you:
- **Identify Interference**: See which networks are impacting your connection and take steps to reduce interference.
- **Optimize Channels**: By understanding channel usage, you can switch to less crowded channels for better performance.
- **Monitor Signal Strength**: Keep track of your networkâ€™s signal strength and make adjustments to improve your connection.
